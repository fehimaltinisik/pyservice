# PyService

## Overview

This **PyService** service is designed to demonstrate Python development skills and follows an organization inspired by
the Spring Boot framework. It provides a baseline for building RESTful APIs in Python and can be used as a starting
point for future projects.

## Features

- RESTful API endpoints for various functionalities.
- Database integration (mention the database you're using, e.g., SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL).
- Dockerized for easy deployment.
- Unit and integration tests (mention testing framework, e.g., pytest).

## Project Structure

The project follows a structured layout for better organization and maintainability, similar to Spring Boot. Here's a
simplified project tree:

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the FastAPI service:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fastapi-service.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Configure your database settings in app/config/settings.py.

4. Run the service locally using Docker Compose:
   ```shell
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
5. Access the API at http://localhost:8000.

## API Documentation

API documentation can be generated dynamically using tools like Swagger UI provided by FastAPI. To access the
documentation, visit http://localhost:8000/docs when the service is running.

## Testing

To run unit and integration tests, use the following command:
```shell
pytest
```

## Deployment
For production deployment, consider using a production-ready server like Uvicorn and a production-ready database.
Configure environment variables for sensitive data.
